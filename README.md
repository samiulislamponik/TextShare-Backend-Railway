## Project Overview

The Text Sharing Web Application is a simple program that allows users to save and share text snippets. Users can enter the text into a text area and save it, and the text is stored in a persistent data store. The program generates a unique URL for each saved text snippet, which can be used to retrieve and edit the text.

## Features

The following features are available in this web application:

-   Users can enter text into a text area and save it.
-   The saved text is stored in a persistent data store.
-   A URL is generated for the saved text which can be used to retrieve and edit the text.
-   When a user follows the URL, the saved text is displayed along with an option to edit the text.
-   When a user clicks the edit button, the text is copied and placed in the same interface used to create new text snippets.

## Error Handling

The API endpoints are designed to handle errors gracefully. If an error occurs while creating, updating, or retrieving a text snippet, the API returns an appropriate error message along with a status code.
